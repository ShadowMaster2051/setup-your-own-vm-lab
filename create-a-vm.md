# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM lab
VM is running Ubuntu.
VM was determined to be non-functional likley due to corrupt driver. Boot failures and hangs occured along with slow-running apps when booted successfully. Attempted to install guest OS utilizing ISO image to no avail. Adjusted RAM allocations to same results. 
4 GB of RAM and a virtual hard disk value of 32GB was chosen for optimal performance according to specification.
Too much RAM could induce active swapping, wherein the VM moves data between its disk space and RAM, due to strain.
RAM was reduced to minimum of 2GB; boot issues persisted. 
Repairing and/or replacing the corrupted driver would enable it to work effectively.
